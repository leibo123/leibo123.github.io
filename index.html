    	<h1>Hi there!</h1>
      <div id="content_index">
        <p>I am presently studying <span style="font-weight:bold">Computer Science</span> at <span style="font-weight:bold">Brown University</span> and expect to graduate in <span style="font-weight:bold">May 2020</span>. I am currently on the Sc.B Professional Track, although I plan to switch over to the 4-year Concurrent Masters Program (also in Computer Science) by the end of my junior year. I like to challenge myself by taking on a rigorous load of coursework each semester in addition to the various activities and extracurriculars that I participate in.</p>
        <p>I have taken <a href="projects.html#coursework" style="text-decoration: underline; color:blue;"><em>many</em></a> computer science courses at Brown, as I generally find these to be the most exciting and interesting. However, in the spirit of Brown's Open Curriculum and as a result of my diverse interests, I have also taken courses in many other disciplines including economics, applied math, English, philosophy, cognitive neuroscience, biotechnology, music, and visual arts.</p>
        <p> In my free time, I like to fold origami, practice violin, play tennis/exercise with friends, or play the board game Go. I also play/develop video games and conduct research in Brown's robotics lab. For more information regarding my coursework and activities please see my <a href="resume.html" style="text-decoration: underline; color:blue;">resume</a> page.</p></p> <br>
        <p>As an aside, click <a href="http://post.browndailyherald.com/2017/09/28/alone-at-home/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline; color:blue;">here</a> for an article that I wrote for Brown's Post- Magazine about adjusting to life in college.</p>
